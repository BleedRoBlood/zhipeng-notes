Lecture 04
==========

Before class:
-------------
- I did a exercise on how to add user and add user to a group.
- I read chapter 6 "Of Users And Groups".
- I knew how to manage user and group in Unix-like system.

After class:
------------
- I learned authentication, like passwords, ssh keys, security tokens, ect.
- Every account has a unique ID and it belongs to at least one group.
- Every file is associated with a uid and a gid and has a number of protection bits.
- Groups enable arbitrary collections of users to share resources and information stored in /etc/group.
- We should remeber all users are equal and some users are more equal than others.
