Lecture 06
==========

Before class:
-------------
- I learned some basic command, such as "tcpdump", "ktrace", "netstat", "nslookup"
- If you don't know your DNS domain name, it can probably be found by looking at the file /etc/resolv.conf on Unix host.
- command: nslookup domain [dns-server] 
	   nslookup -qt=type domain [dns-server]
- command: dig -t a www.google.com +noall +answer
	   dig -t ns www.google.com
	   dig -t a www.google.com
	   dig -t mx www.google.com
